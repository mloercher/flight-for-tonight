## Activity Instructions:

Select an origin, destination, date and price parameter then click search to get cheapest flight available to destination. 

    *If not receiving results after multiple tries, make sure local storage is empty and try again. To avoid this issue, we implemented a 'New Search' button at the bottom of the results list to clear local storage automatically.
